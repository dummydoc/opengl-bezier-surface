# Bézier Surfaces & Realistic Rendering Techniques (Shader-based OpenGL)
Shader-based OpenGL program which draws Bézier surfaces (a type of mathematical splines, a 3D extension of Bézier curves) in wireframe, Gouraud Shaded, or Phong Shaded form, depending on the users choice. User can apply shading methods and rendering techniques to Bézier Surfaces.

## Requirements
* OpenGL 3.2 +

## Features
* User should click the screen to make dots. 
* By using 'w'(+) and 's'(-) keys you can determine z coordinate. When coordinates are determined, user should press the 'a' key to add point.
* User should press 'b' key to draw bezier surface.
* User can apply the following functionalities and methods through menu
  - Camera controls (rotation, zoom in/out)
  - Shading methods (Wireframe, Gouraud shading, Phong shading)
  - Rendering techniques (Parametric Texture Mapping, Bump Mapping, Environment Mapping)
